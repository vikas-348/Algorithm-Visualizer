# Algorithm-Visualizer
Algorithm visualization illustrates how algorithms and Advance data structure work in a
graphical way. It mainly aims to simplify and deepen the understanding of algorithm opera-
tion.Using professional articles of algorithms, animations, and responsive design , each algo-
rithm can be learnt easily, Helps students identify their strengths and areas for improvement,
Revisit topics multiple times and practice.Every software engineer should have a good un-
derstanding of Algorithms to develop efficient software. Visualizers have a good history of
providing effective understanding to the users.

## Problem Statement:
To create a Classroom Management System using Python and Django. 
It is an integrated web application that handles various academic and non-academic activities of a College/ Academic Institute which can be accessed by student/teacher through internet connected devices. 
Various functionalities are provided based on the user category either student/teacher. It will have a friendly user interface and would help maintain records of each students.
