# Algorithm-Visualizer
Algorithm visualization illustrates how algorithms and Advance data structure work in a
graphical way. It mainly aims to simplify and deepen the understanding of algorithm opera-
tion.Using professional articles of algorithms, animations, and responsive design , each algo-
rithm can be learnt easily, Helps students identify their strengths and areas for improvement,
Revisit topics multiple times and practice.Every software engineer should have a good un-
derstanding of Algorithms to develop efficient software. Visualizers have a good history of
providing effective understanding to the users.

### Are you a first-timer in contributing to open source? These guidelines from GitHub might help!

## Running Locally
1. Create a New_Folder and clone Alogorithm-visualizer and Server within New_Folder.
2. Fork this repository.

3. Clone your forked repo to your New_Folder (Alogorithm-visualizer).

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/algorithm-visualizer.git    
    ```
 4. Install dependencies, and run the web app.

    ```bash
    cd algorithm-visualizer
    npm install
    npm uninstall -g sass
    npm i node-sass@4.14.0
    npm start
    ```
  5.  Clone your forked repo to your New_Folder (Server).
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/algorithm-visualizer.git   
      ```

 
    
  6. Create `.env.local` in your Server project root:
      ```bash
      # By putting dummy values, GitHub sign in will not work locally
      GITHUB_CLIENT_ID = dummy
      GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET = dummy

      # By putting dummy values, extracting visualizing commands will not work locally (except for JavaScript).
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = dummy
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = dummy
       ```
  7. Install dependencies, and run the Server.
     ```bash
     npm install
     npm run watch
     ```
### Now UI is Ready
To begin, visit https://algorithm-visualizer.org/ and navigate to the algorithm section. Select the specific algorithm you wish to visualize. Once you have       chosen an algorithm, copy and paste its corresponding code into the provided "code.js" box on the left side of the page. Next, click on the "build" button to     initiate the visualization process. Finally, click on the "play" button to start the visualization of the selected algorithm.
